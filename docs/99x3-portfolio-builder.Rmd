Using the same dataset leveraged for Portfolio Builder Exercise [#1](https://misk-data-science.github.io/misk-homl/docs/99x1-portfolio-builder.html) & [#2](https://misk-data-science.github.io/misk-homl/docs/99x2-portfolio-builder.html), write up a third report that answers the following:

1. Apply a MARS model with all features.
   - How does the model performance compare to your previous models?
   - How many of the features are influential? Which 10 features are considered most influential?
   - Does your model include hinge functions? If so, explain their coefficient and plot their impact on the predicted response variable.
   - Does your model include interactions? If so, pick the interaction effect that is most influential and explain the coefficient.
   
2. Apply a random forest model.
   - First, apply a default random forest model.
   - Now apply a a full cartesian grid search across various values of $m_{try}$, tree complexity & sampling scheme.
   - Now run a random grid search across the same hyperparameter grid but restrict the time or number of models to run to 50% of the models ran in the full cartesian.

3. Pick the best performing model from above.
   - Identify the most influential features for this model.
   - Plot the top 10 most influential features.
   - Do these features have positive or negative impacts on your response variable?
   - Create partial dependence plots for these features. Explain the relationship between the feature and the predicted values.
