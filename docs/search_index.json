This book provides hands-on modules for many of the most common machine learning methods to include: A proper modeling process Feature engineering Linear and logistic regression Regularized models K-nearest neighbors Random forests Gradient boosting machines Stacking / super learners And more! You will learn how to build and tune these various models with R and Python packages that have been tested and approved due to their ability to scale well. However, our motivation in almost every case is to describe the techniques in a way that helps develop intuition for its strengths and weaknesses. For the most part, we minimize mathematical complexity when possible but also provide resources to get deeper into the details if desired. Who should read this TBD This module makes a few assumptions of your established knowledge regarding your programming skills. Below are some important assumptions made and resources to read through if you feel inadequately prepared: Complete after rest of material is finalized.

When discussing one or the other we will typically label with the appropriate icons: Python: R: In addition to the general text used throughout, you will notice the following code chunks: Signifies a tip or suggestion Signifies a general note Signifies a warning or caution Feedback Reader comments are greatly appreciated.
