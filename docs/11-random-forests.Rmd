_Random forests_ are a modification of bagged decision trees that build a large collection of _de-correlated_ trees to further improve predictive performance. They have become a very popular "out-of-the-box" or "off-the-shelf" learning algorithm that enjoys good predictive performance with relatively little hyperparameter tuning. Many modern implementations of random forests exist; however, Leo Breiman's algorithm [@breiman2001random] has largely become the authoritative procedure. This module will cover the fundamentals of random forests.


# Prerequisites

This module leverages the following packages. Some of these packages play a supporting role; however, the emphasis is on how to implement random forests with the __ranger__ [@JSSv077i01] and __h2o__ packages.

```{r rf-pkg-req}
# Helper packages
library(dplyr)    # for data wrangling
library(ggplot2)  # for awesome graphics

# Modeling packages
library(ranger)   # a c++ implementation of random forest 
library(h2o)      # a java-based implementation of random forest
library(rsample)  # resampling procedures
```

We'll continue working with the `ames_train` data set to illustrate the main concepts.

```{r rf-ames-train}
# create Ames training data
ames <- AmesHousing::make_ames()
set.seed(123)
ames <- AmesHousing::make_ames()
split  <- initial_split(ames, prop = 0.7, strata = "Sale_Price")
ames_train  <- training(split)
```

# Extending bagging

Random forests are built using the same fundamental principles as decision trees and bagging. Bagging trees introduces a random component into the tree building process by building many trees on bootstrapped copies of the training data. Bagging then aggregates the predictions across all the trees; this aggregation reduces the variance of the overall procedure and results in improved predictive performance. However, as we saw in the last module, simply bagging trees results in tree correlation that limits the effect of variance reduction. 

Random forests help to reduce tree correlation by injecting more randomness into the tree-growing process.^[See @esl for a mathematical explanation of the tree correlation phenomenon.] More specifically, while growing a decision tree during the bagging process, random forests perform _split-variable randomization_ where each time a split is to be performed, the search for the split variable is limited to a random subset of $m_{try}$ of the original $p$ features.  Typical default values are $m_{try} = \frac{p}{3}$ (regression) and $m_{try} = \sqrt{p}$ (classification) but this should be considered a tuning parameter.  

The basic algorithm for a regression or classification random forest can be generalized as follows:

```
1.  Given a training data set
2.  Select number of trees to build (n_trees)
3.  for i = 1 to n_trees do
4.  |  Generate a bootstrap sample of the original data
5.  |  Grow a regression/classification tree to the bootstrapped data
6.  |  for each split do
7.  |  | Select m_try variables at random from all p variables
8.  |  | Pick the best variable/split-point among the m_try
9.  |  | Split the node into two child nodes
10. |  end
11. | Use typical tree model stopping criteria to determine when a 
    | tree is complete (but do not prune)
12. end
13. Output ensemble of trees 
```

> ___Pro Tip:___ _When $m_{try} = p$, the algorithm is equivalent to bagging decision trees._

Since the algorithm randomly selects a bootstrap sample to train on ___and___ a random sample of features to use at each split, a more diverse set of trees is produced which tends to lessen tree correlation beyond bagged trees and often dramatically increase predictive power.

# Out-of-the-box performance

Random forests have become popular because they tend to provide very good out-of-the-box performance. Although they have several hyperparameters that can be tuned, the default values tend to produce good results. Moreover, @probst2018tunability illustrated that among the more popular machine learning algorithms, random forests have the least variability in their prediction accuracy when tuning. 

For example, if we train a random forest model^[Here we use the __ranger__ package to fit a baseline random forest. It is common for folks to first learn to implement random forests by using the original __randomForest__ package [@randomForest]. Although __randomForest__ is a great package with many bells and whistles, __ranger__ provides a much faster C++ implementation of the same algorithm.] with all hyperparameters set to their default values, we get an OOB RMSE that is comparable to some of the best model's we've run thus far (without any tuning).

___Pro Tip:___ _By default, **ranger** sets the `mtry` parameter to $\text{floor}\big(\sqrt{\texttt{number of features}}\big)$; however, for regression problems the preferred `mtry` to start with is $\text{floor}\big(\frac{\texttt{number of features}}{3}\big)$. We also set `respect.unordered.factors = "order"`. This specifies how to treat unordered factor variables and we recommend setting this to "order" (see @esl Section 9.2.4 for details)._

```{r out-of-box-rf}
# number of features
n_features <- length(setdiff(names(ames_train), "Sale_Price"))

# train a default random forest model
ames_rf1 <- ranger(
  Sale_Price ~ ., 
  data = ames_train,
  mtry = floor(n_features / 3),
  respect.unordered.factors = "order",
  seed = 123
)

# get OOB RMSE
(default_rmse <- sqrt(ames_rf1$prediction.error))
```

# Hyperparameters

Although random forests perform well out-of-the-box, there are several tunable hyperparameters that we should consider when training a model. Although we briefly discuss the main hyperparameters, @probst2019hyperparameters provide a much more thorough discussion.  The main hyperparameters to consider include:

(1) The number of trees in the forest
(2) The number of features to consider at any given split: $m_{try}$
(3) The complexity of each tree
(4) The sampling scheme
(5) The splitting rule to use during tree construction

(1) and (2) typically have the largest impact on predictive accuracy and should always be tuned. (3) and (4) tend to have marginal impact on predictive accuracy but are still worth exploring. They also have the ability to influence computational efficiency. (5) tends to have the smallest impact on predictive accuracy and is used primarily to increase computational efficiency.

## Number of trees

The first consideration is the number of trees within your random forest. Although not technically a hyperparameter, the number of trees needs to be sufficiently large to stabilize the error rate. A good rule of thumb is to start with 10 times the number of features as illustrated below); however, as you adjust other hyperparameters such as $m_{try}$ and node size, more or fewer trees may be required. More trees provide more robust and stable error estimates and variable importance measures; however, the impact on computation time increases linearly with the number of trees.

> ___Pro Tip:___ _Start with $p \times 10$ trees and adjust as necessary_

```{r tuning-trees, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The Ames data has 80 features and starting with 10 times the number of features typically ensures the error estimate converges.", fig.height=3.5, fig.width=6}
# number of features
n_features <- ncol(ames_train) - 1

# tuning grid
tuning_grid <- expand.grid(
  trees = seq(10, 1000, by = 20),
  rmse  = NA
)

for(i in seq_len(nrow(tuning_grid))) {

  # Fit a random forest
  fit <- ranger(
    formula = Sale_Price ~ ., 
    data = ames_train, 
    num.trees = tuning_grid$trees[i],
    mtry = floor(n_features / 3),
    respect.unordered.factors = 'order',
    verbose = FALSE,
    seed = 123
  )
  
  # Extract OOB RMSE
  tuning_grid$rmse[i] <- sqrt(fit$prediction.error)
  
}

ggplot(tuning_grid, aes(trees, rmse)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  ylab("OOB Error (RMSE)") +
  xlab("Number of trees")
```

## $m_{try}$ {#mtry}

The hyperparameter that controls the split-variable randomization feature of random forests is often referred to as $m_{try}$ and it helps to balance low tree correlation with reasonable predictive strength. With regression problems the default value is often $m_{try} = \frac{p}{3}$ and for classification $m_{try} = \sqrt{p}$. However, when there are fewer relevant predictors (e.g., noisy data) a higher value of $m_{try}$ tends to perform better because it makes it more likely to select those features with the strongest signal. When there are many relevant predictors, a lower $m_{try}$ might perform better.

> ___Pro Tip:___ _Start with five evenly spaced values of $m_{try}$ across the range 2--$p$ centered at the recommended default as illustrated below. For the Ames data, an mtry value slightly lower (21) than the default (26) improves performance._

```{r tuning-mtry, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="For the Ames data, an mtry value slightly lower (21) than the default (26) improves performance.", fig.height=3.5}
tuning_grid <- expand.grid(
  trees = seq(10, 1000, by = 20),

  rmse  = NA
)

  fit <- ranger(
  formula    = Sale_Price ~ .,

  num.trees  = tuning_grid$trees[i],
  mtry       = tuning_grid$mtry[i],
  respect.unordered.factors = 'order',
  verbose    = FALSE,
  seed       = 123
)
  
  tuning_grid$rmse[i] <- sqrt(fit$prediction.error)
  
}
labels <- tuning_grid %>%
  filter(trees == 990) %>%

  ylab("OOB Error (RMSE)") +
  xlab("Number of trees")
```

## Tree complexity

Random forests are built on individual decision trees; consequently, most random forest implementations have one or more hyperparameters that allow us to control the depth and complexity of the individual trees.  This will often include hyperparameters such as node size, max depth, max number of terminal nodes, or the required node size to allow additional splits. Node size is probably the most common hyperparameter to control tree complexity and most implementations use the default values of one for classification and five for regression as these values tend to produce good results [@diaz2006gene; @goldstein2011random]. However, @segal2004machine showed that if your data has many noisy predictors and higher $m_{try}$ values are performing best, then performance may improve by increasing node size (i.e., decreasing tree depth and complexity). Moreover, if computation time is a concern then you can often decrease run time substantially by increasing the node size and have only marginal impacts to your error estimate as illustrated below.

> ___Pro Tip:___ _When adjusting node size start with three values between 1--10 and adjust depending on impact to accuracy and run time. Increasing node size to reduce tree complexity will often have a larger impact on computation speed (right) than on your error estimate._

```{r tuning-node-size, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Increasing node size to reduce tree complexity will often have a larger impact on computation speed (right) than on your error estimate.", fig.width=10, fig.height=3.5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
tuning_grid <- expand.grid(

    )

  xlab("Minimum node size") +
  ggtitle("B) Impact to run time")

gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)
```

## Sampling scheme

The default sampling scheme for random forests is bootstrapping where 100% of the observations are sampled with replacement (in other words, each bootstrap copy has the same size as the original training data); however, we can adjust both the sample size and whether to sample with or without replacement. The sample size parameter determines how many observations are drawn for the training of each tree. Decreasing the sample size leads to more diverse trees and thereby lower between-tree correlation, which can have a positive effect on the prediction accuracy. Consequently, if there are a few dominating features in your data set, reducing the sample size can also help to minimize between-tree correlation. 

Also, when you have many categorical features with a varying number of levels, sampling with replacement can lead to biased variable split selection [@janitza2016pitfalls; @strobl2007bias]. Consequently, if you have categories that are not balanced, sampling without replacement provides a less biased use of all levels across the trees in the random forest.

> ___Pro Tip:___ _Assess 3--4 values of sample sizes ranging from 25%--100% and if you have unbalanced categorical features try sampling without replacement. The Ames data has several imbalanced categorical features such as neighborhood, zoning, overall quality, and more. Consequently, sampling without replacement appears to improve performance as it leads to less biased split variable selection and more uncorrelated trees._

```{r tuning-sampling-scheme, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The Ames data has several imbalanced categorical features such as neighborhood, zoning, overall quality, and more. Consequently, sampling without replacement appears to improve performance as it leads to less biased split variable selection and more uncorrelated trees.", fig.height=3.5, fig.width=6}
tuning_grid <- expand.grid(
  sample.fraction = seq(.05, .95, by = .05),
  replace  = c(TRUE, FALSE),
  rmse = NA
)

    formula    = Sale_Price ~ ., 
    data       = ames_train, 
    num.trees  = 1000,
    mtry       = 26,
    sample.fraction = tuning_grid$sample.fraction[i],
    replace = tuning_grid$replace[i],
    respect.unordered.factors = 'order',
    verbose    = FALSE,
    seed       = 123
  )

  tuning_grid$rmse[i] <- sqrt(fit$prediction.error)
  
}

  theme(legend.position = c(0.8, 0.85),
        legend.key = element_blank(),
        legend.background = element_blank())
```

## Split rule

Recall the default splitting rule during random forests tree building consists of selecting, out of all splits of the (randomly selected $m_{try}$) candidate variables, the split that minimizes the Gini impurity (in the case of classification) and the SSE (in case of regression). However, @strobl2007bias illustrated that these default splitting rules favor the selection of features with many possible splits (e.g., continuous variables or categorical variables with many categories) over variables with fewer splits (the extreme case being binary variables, which have only one possible split). _Conditional inference trees_ [@hothorn2006unbiased] implement an alternative splitting mechanism that helps to reduce this variable selection bias.^[Conditional inference trees are available in the __partykit__ [@hothorn2015partykit] and __ranger__ packages among others.] However, ensembling conditional inference trees has yet to be proven superior with regards to predictive accuracy and they take a lot longer to train.

To increase computational efficiency, splitting rules can be randomized where only a random subset of possible splitting values is considered for a variable [@geurts2006extremely]. If only a single random splitting value is randomly selected then we call this procedure _extremely randomized trees_. Due to the added randomness of split points, this method tends to have no improvement, or often a negative impact, on predictive accuracy.  

Regarding runtime, extremely randomized trees are the fastest as the cutpoints are drawn completely randomly, followed by the classical random forest, while for conditional inference forests the runtime is the largest [@probst2019hyperparameters].

> ___Pro Tip:___ _If you need to increase computation time significantly try completely randomized trees; however, be sure to assess predictive accuracy to traditional split rules as this approach often has a negative impact on your loss function._

# Tuning strategies {#rf-tuning-strategy}

## Cartesian grid search

As we introduce more complex algorithms with greater number of hyperparameters, we should become more strategic with our tuning strategies. One way to become more strategic is to consider how we proceed through our grid search.  Up to this point, all our grid searches have been _full Cartesian grid searches_ where we assess every combination of hyperparameters of interest. We could continue to do the same; for example, the next code block searches across 120 combinations of hyperparameter settings.

> ___Warning:___ _This grid search takes approximately 2 minutes._

```{r ranger-grid-search}
# create hyperparameter grid
hyper_grid <- expand.grid(
  mtry = floor(n_features * c(.05, .15, .25, .333, .4)),
  min.node.size = c(1, 3, 5, 10), 
  replace = c(TRUE, FALSE),                               
  sample.fraction = c(.5, .63, .8),                       
  rmse = NA                                               
)

# execute full cartesian grid search
for(i in seq_len(nrow(hyper_grid))) {
  # fit model for ith hyperparameter combination
  fit <- ranger(
    formula         = Sale_Price ~ ., 
    data            = ames_train, 
    num.trees       = n_features * 10,
    mtry            = hyper_grid$mtry[i],
    min.node.size   = hyper_grid$min.node.size[i],
    replace         = hyper_grid$replace[i],
    sample.fraction = hyper_grid$sample.fraction[i],
    verbose         = FALSE,
    seed            = 123,
    respect.unordered.factors = 'order',
  )
  # export OOB error 
  hyper_grid$rmse[i] <- sqrt(fit$prediction.error)
}

# assess top 10 models
hyper_grid %>%
  arrange(rmse) %>%
  mutate(perc_gain = (default_rmse - rmse) / default_rmse * 100) %>%
  head(10)
```

If we look at the results we see that the top 10 models are all around an RMSE of 25000 (a 1.0%--1.6% improvement over our baseline model). In these results, the default `mtry` value of $\left \lfloor{\frac{\texttt{# features}}{3}}\right \rfloor = 26$ is nearly sufficient and smaller node sizes (deeper trees) perform best. What stands out the most is that taking less than 100% sample rate and sampling without replacement consistently performs best. Sampling less than 100% adds additional randomness in the procedure, which helps to further de-correlate the trees. Sampling without replacement likely improves performance because this data has a lot of high cardinality categorical features that are imbalanced.

## Random grid search

However, as we add more hyperparameters and values to search across and as our data sets become larger, you can see how a full Cartesian search can become exhaustive and computationally expensive. In addition to full Cartesian search, the __h2o__ package provides a _random grid search_ that allows you to jump from one random combination to another and it also provides _early stopping_ rules that allow you to stop the grid search once a certain condition is met (e.g., a certain number of models have been trained, a certain runtime has elapsed, or the accuracy has stopped improving by a certain amount). Although using a random discrete search path will likely not find the optimal model, it typically does a good job of finding a very good model.

To fit a random forest model with __h2o__, we first need to initiate our __h2o__ session.

```{r h2o-init}
h2o.no_progress()
h2o.init(max_mem_size = "5g")
```

Next, we need to convert our training and test data sets to objects that __h2o__ can work with.

```{r h2o-objects}
# convert training data to h2o object
train_h2o <- as.h2o(ames_train)

# set the response column to Sale_Price
response <- "Sale_Price"

# set the predictor names
predictors <- setdiff(colnames(ames_train), response)
```

The following fits a default random forest model with __h2o__ to illustrate that our baseline results ($\text{OOB RMSE} = 26,079$) are very similar to the baseline __ranger__ model we fit earlier.

```{r h2o-baseline}
h2o_rf1 <- h2o.randomForest(
    x = predictors, 
    y = response,
    training_frame = train_h2o, 
    ntrees = n_features * 10,
    seed = 123
)

h2o_rf1
```

To execute a grid search in __h2o__ we need our hyperparameter grid to be a list. For example, the following code searches a larger grid space than before with a total of 240 hyperparameter combinations. We then create a random grid search strategy that will stop if none of the last 10 models have managed to have a 0.1% improvement in MSE compared to the best model before that. If we continue to find improvements then we cut the grid search off after 300 seconds (5 minutes). 

```{r h20-random-search-setup}
# hyperparameter grid
hyper_grid <- list(
  mtries = floor(n_features * c(.05, .15, .25, .333, .4)),
  min_rows = c(1, 3, 5, 10),
  max_depth = c(10, 20, 30),
  sample_rate = c(.55, .632, .70, .80)
)

# random grid search strategy
search_criteria <- list(
  strategy = "RandomDiscrete",
  stopping_metric = "mse",
  stopping_tolerance = 0.001,   # stop if improvement is < 0.1%
  stopping_rounds = 10,         # over the last 10 models
  max_runtime_secs = 60*5      # or stop search after 5 min.
)
```

We can then perform the grid search with `h2o.grid()`. The following executes the grid search with early stopping turned on.  The early stopping we specify below in `h2o.grid()` will stop growing an individual random forest model if we have not experienced at least a 0.05% improvement in the overall OOB error in the last 10 trees. This is very useful as we can specify to build 1000 trees for each random forest model but __h2o__ may only build 200 trees if we don't experience any improvement.

> ___Warning:___ _This grid search takes 5 minutes._


```{r h20-random-search-execution}
# perform grid search 
random_grid <- h2o.grid(
  algorithm = "randomForest",
  grid_id = "rf_random_grid",
  x = predictors, 
  y = response, 
  training_frame = train_h2o,
  hyper_params = hyper_grid,
  ntrees = n_features * 10,
  seed = 123,
  stopping_metric = "RMSE",   
  stopping_rounds = 10,           # stop if last 10 trees added 
  stopping_tolerance = 0.005,     # don't improve RMSE by 0.5%
  search_criteria = search_criteria
)
```

Our grid search assessed __153__ models before stopping due to time. The best model (`max_depth = 20`, `min_rows = 1`, `mtries = 32`, and `sample_rate = 0.8`) achieved an OOB RMSE of 25646. So although our random search assessed about 30% of the number of models as a full grid search would, the more efficient random search found a near-optimal model within the specified time constraint.


```{r h2o-grid-search-results}
# collect the results and sort by our model performance metric 
# of choice
random_grid_perf <- h2o.getGrid(
  grid_id = "rf_random_grid", 
  sort_by = "mse", 
  decreasing = FALSE
)
random_grid_perf
```

# Feature interpretation {#rf-vip}

Computing feature importance and feature effects for random forests follow the same procedure as discussed in the bagging module. However, in addition to the impurity-based measure of feature importance where we base feature importance on the average total reduction of the loss function for a given feature across all trees, random forests also typically include a _permutation-based_ importance measure. In the permutation-based approach, for each tree, the OOB sample is passed down the tree and the prediction accuracy is recorded. Then the values for each variable (one at a time) are randomly permuted and the accuracy is again computed. The decrease in accuracy as a result of this randomly shuffling of feature values is averaged over all the trees for each predictor. The variables with the largest average decrease in accuracy are considered most important.

For example, we can compute both measures of feature importance with __ranger__ by setting the `importance` argument.

> ___Pro Tip:___ _For **ranger**, once you’ve identified the optimal parameter values from the grid search, you will want to re-run your model with these hyperparameter values. You can also crank up the number of trees, which will help create more stables values of variable importance._


```{r feature-importance}
# re-run model with impurity-based variable importance
rf_impurity <- ranger(
  formula = Sale_Price ~ ., 
  data = ames_train, 
  num.trees = 2000,
  mtry = 32,
  min.node.size = 1,
  sample.fraction = .80,
  replace = FALSE,
  importance = "impurity",
  respect.unordered.factors = "order",
  verbose = FALSE,
  seed  = 123
)

# re-run model with permutation-based variable importance
rf_permutation <- ranger(
  formula = Sale_Price ~ ., 
  data = ames_train, 
  num.trees = 2000,
  mtry = 32,
  min.node.size = 1,
  sample.fraction = .80,
  replace = FALSE,
  importance = "permutation",
  respect.unordered.factors = "order",
  verbose = FALSE,
  seed  = 123
)
```

The resulting VIPs are displayed below. Typically, you will not see the same variable importance order between the two options; however, you will often see similar variables at the top of the plots (and also the bottom). Consequently, in this example, we can comfortably state that there appears to be enough evidence to suggest that three variables stand out as most influential:

- `Overall_Qual`  
- `Gr_Liv_Area`  
- `Neighborhood`

Looking at the next ~10 variables in both plots, you will also see some commonality in influential variables (e.g., `Garage_Cars`, `Exter_Qual`, `Bsmt_Qual`, and `Year_Built`).

```{r feature-importance-plot, fig.cap="Top 25 most important variables based on impurity (left) and permutation (right).", fig.height=4.5, fig.width=10}
p1 <- vip::vip(rf_impurity, num_features = 25, geom = "point")
p2 <- vip::vip(rf_permutation, num_features = 25, geom = "point")

gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)
```

# Final thoughts

Random forests provide a very powerful out-of-the-box algorithm that often has great predictive accuracy. They come with all the benefits of decision trees (with the exception of surrogate splits) and bagging but greatly reduce instability and between-tree correlation. And due to the added split variable selection attribute, random forests are also faster than bagging as they have a smaller feature search space at each tree split. However, random forests will still suffer from slow computational speed as your data sets get larger but, similar to bagging, the algorithm is built upon independent steps, and most modern implementations (e.g., __ranger__, __h2o__) allow for parallelization to improve training time.

# Python

The following resources provide detailed examples of performing random forests with Python and Scikit Learn:

- Jordan Crouser's [lab notebook](http://www.science.smith.edu/~jcrouser/SDS293/labs/lab14-py.html) on random forests for Smith College Machine Learning course (sections 8.3.3).
- Machine Learning Mastery's post on [How to Develop a Random Forest Ensemble in Python](https://machinelearningmastery.com/random-forest-ensemble-in-python/).
- Chapter 7 of [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow-dp-1492032646/dp/1492032646/ref=dp_ob_title_bk) and the accompanying publicly available [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2/blob/master/07_ensemble_learning_and_random_forests.ipynb) regarding random forests (code chunks 15-24).
- Chris Albon's [numerous tutorials](https://chrisalbon.com/) on random forests (look for the _Trees and Forests_ section).

# Exercises

Using the Boston housing data set from the pdp package, where the response feature is the median value of homes within a census tract (`cmedv`):

1. Apply a default random forest model with the same features you used in the bagging module. How does the out-of-the-box random forest model perform compared to the bagging module?
2. Assess the number of trees in your random forest model.
   - How many trees are applied?
   - Was it enough to stabilize the loss function or do you need to add more?
3. Perform a full cartesian grid search across various values of:
   - $m_{try}$
   - tree complexity (i.e. max depth, node size)
   - sampling scheme
4. How long did the above grid search take? Which model gave the best performance?
5. Now run a random grid search across the same hyperparameter grid but restrict the time or number of models to run to 50% of the models ran in the full cartesian. How does the random grid search results compare?
6. Pick your best random forest model. Which 10 features are considered most influential? Are these the same features that have been influential in previous models?
7. Create partial dependence plots for the top two most influential features. Explain the relationship between the feature and the predicted values.
8. Now perform 1-7 to the Attrition dataset, which is classification model rather than a regression model.
9.  **Python challenge**: Repeat the above exercises but using Python and Scikit Learn.
