## Overview

Students will learn many of the most common machine learning methods to include:

-	A proper modeling process 
-	Feature engineering
-	Linear and logistic regression 
-	Regularized models 
-	K-nearest neighbors 
-	Random forests 
-	Gradient boosting machines 
-	Stacking / super learners 
-	And more!

This module will teach students how to build and tune these various models with R and Python packages that have been tested and approved due to their ability to scale well (i.e. Scikit-Learn, xgboost, h2o). However, the motivation in almost every case is to describe the techniques in a way that helps develop intuition for its strengths and weaknesses.
