## Overview

Students will learn many of the most common machine learning methods to include:

-	A proper modeling process 
-	Feature engineering
-	Linear and logistic regression 
-	Regularized models 
-	K-nearest neighbors 
-	Random forests 
-	Gradient boosting machines 
-	Stacking / super learners 
-	And more!

This module will teach students how to build and tune these various models with R and Python packages that have been tested and approved due to their ability to scale well (i.e. Scikit-Learn, xgboost, h2o). However, the motivation in almost every case is to describe the techniques in a way that helps develop intuition for its strengths and weaknesses.

## Prework

This module makes a few assumptions of your established knowledge regarding your programming skills and exposure to basic statistical concepts. Below are my assumptions and some resources to read through to make sure you are properly prepared.

## Schedule

This module will use [__Hands-On Machine Learning with R__](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/) as the primary text. Although this book demonstrates examples using R, example code is also provided in the Python resources so students can implement the same steps and algorithms using Python. Students can also use [__Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow__](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1492032646/ref=dp_ob_image_bk) as an additional supporting text book which demonstrates many of the same concepts with Python.
