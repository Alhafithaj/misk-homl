## Overview

Students will learn many of the most common machine learning methods to include:

-	A proper modeling process 
-	Feature engineering
-	Linear and logistic regression 
-	Regularized models 
-	K-nearest neighbors 
-	Random forests 
-	Gradient boosting machines 
-	Stacking / super learners 
-	And more!

This module will teach students how to build and tune these various models with R packages that have been tested and approved due to their ability to scale well (i.e. glmnet, ranger, xgboost, h2o). However, the motivation in almost every case is to describe the techniques in a way that helps develop intuition for its strengths and weaknesses.
